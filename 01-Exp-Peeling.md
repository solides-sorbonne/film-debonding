# Experiment: Peeling test

1. Try to peel of the transparent adhesive tape by applying a force perpendicular to the substrate/ And then parallel to the substrate. What do you observe ?

2. Redo the experiment with the brown tape. Do you observe the same behavior ?

3. Conclude from these observations whether the peeling force can be used to characterize the resistance of an adhesive tape, irrespective of the loading conditions ?

You can report here your observation
